# 🌍 Air Quality Index Dashboard
## 📌 Overview
The Air Quality Index (AQI) Dashboard visualizes air quality data across various countries, providing valuable insights into pollution levels, trends over the years, and the distribution of AQI statuses. This tool is designed to assist policymakers, environmentalists, and the general public in understanding and addressing air quality concerns.

## 📊 Data Source
The data used in this dashboard includes:

🌏 Countries: Air quality metrics for countries with the poorest AQI.
📆 Years: Trends in AQI values from 2022 to 2025.
🟠 AQI Status: Distribution of air quality levels (e.g., hazardous, unhealthy, moderate) across the highlighted countries.
